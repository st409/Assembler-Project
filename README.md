# Assembler Project

## Overview
The Assembler Project is a tool designed to simplify the process of assembling code written in a custom assembly-like language. This project offers features for encoding instructions, handling parameters, and more.

## Features
- **Instruction Encoding:** Efficiently encode assembly instructions with a custom format. The encoding process supports a 15-bit instruction set where specific bits are designated for fixed patterns, addressing methods, and opcodes.  
- **Custom Assembly Language:** Work with a custom assembly language that allows you to define and manipulate instructions and operands tailored to your needs.  
- **Parameter Handling:** Handle various types of parameters, including immediate values, register-based operands, and memory addresses, all while adhering to a defined bit pattern.  
- **Debugging and Error Handling:** Robust error handling and debugging support to ensure accurate instruction processing and to facilitate troubleshooting during development.  

## Key Files
- `run`: The compiled assembler executable.  
- `makefile`: Build configuration for the project.  

## Build the Project
To build the project, use the provided Makefile:

```bash
make

This will compile all the necessary files and create the `shevy.as` executable.

## Running the Project

To run the project, use the following command:

* ./run file1 file2 ... fileN

**Important Note on File Names:**
When specifying input files, omit the `.as` suffix. The assembler will automatically add `.as` to the input file names.

## Input Files

Input files should be in `.as` format and must include valid assembly code that adheres to the specified language syntax.

## Output Files

For each input file, the assembler produces the following output files:

* `.am` file: Contains the input file after macro expansion.
* `.ob` file: The object file that includes the compiled machine code.
* `.ent` file: Lists the entry points defined in the assembly code (if any).
* `.ext` file: Details external references used in the assembly code (if any).

## Binary Translation Process

During the assembly process, each instruction in the source code is converted into binary machine code through the following steps:

* **Instruction Encoding:** Each instruction is transformed into binary, with both the operation code (opcode) and operands encoded based on the chosen addressing mode (e.g., immediate, direct, or indirect).
* **Label Resolution:** Operands that are labels are replaced with their respective memory addresses from the symbol table. External references are noted and marked in the binary output.
* **A, R, E Fields:** Each binary word includes A, R, and E fields to facilitate proper linkage and loading of the machine code.

## Error Handling

The assembler includes extensive error checking to detect and report problems such as syntax errors, undefined symbols, undefined operations, and other problems that arise during the assembly process.

## Memory Management

This project showcases advanced memory management techniques in C, including:

* Efficient allocation and deallocation of memory
* Effective use of dynamic memory allocation
* Prevention of memory leaks through meticulous resource management
* Optimization of data structures to reduce memory usage
